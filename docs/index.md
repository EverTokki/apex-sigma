**Apex Sigma** is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot that aims to bring knowledge and data to your guilds.

> **Sigma** was initially designed and made to connect to as many API endpoints as we can get access to. It started with a planned 50 APIs, and more kept stacking out of nowhere. Soon, we were adding moderator commands, utilities, mini-games and music. Started work on an interactive web panel and more ideas are pouring in! Earning her the title of "The API Giant".

## Modules

- **Administration** - Commands for managing the bot itself. These are limited only to developers.
- **Fun** - These aren't too useful but are interesting. Maybe you're in the mood for some comics, cringe jokes or just pictures of cats.
- **Games** - Various functions to show player profiles and browse game data like information on a certain `>>pokemon` or your `>>osu`! statistics.
- **Interactions** - What would the community be without these? After you `>>punch` your friend, give them a `>>hug` and a `>>kiss`!
- **Minigames** - Small and fun things to do when you're bored. Flip a coin, play some rock-paper-scissors or spin some `>>slots`, or just chill out and `>>fish`.
- **Moderation** - Tools to help you manage and control your guilds. Maybe you want to set a message to `>>greet` joining users or just plain `>>ban` a person for posting too much lasagna pics.
- **Music** - Really doubt this needs explanation. `>>play` a song either by name, or by a YouTube or SoundCloud link.
- **Nihongo** - If you are like me, you are probably a filthy weeb. These commands let you search `>>jisho` for words and their definitions as well as check your `>>wanikani` data.
- **NSFW** - Not gonna explain anything, I'll just leave this Lenny face here ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)...
- **Points** - Sigma has her internal currency system. You can check the amound of `>>kud` you have and see your server's `>>ranking`!
- **Roles** - Make roles, destroy them, give them and take them away. Add some self assignable roles and check how many you have on the server. So many functions.
- **Searches** - Look for songs, recipes, images, movies, subreddits, urban definitions, wikipedia and other stuff with these commands.
- **Shop** - Want to reward the people who have been so lovely and active on your server? Add some neat role to the shop list which they can buy with `>>kud` for the price you set.
- **Utility** - Honestly this has so much stuff in it that the best explanation is simply "Stuff you might need". Get info on a user, server, channel, make a `>>poll` or `>>translate` something.
